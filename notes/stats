  measures of frequency === frequency
  measures of dispersion === range, standard deviation, variance
  regarding the entire population
inferential === making inferences from samples
  hypothesis testing
  regarding the sample
  normal distribution === N(μ, σ^2)
    μ (mean), σ^2 (variance) === population parameters (of the normal distribution)
    these parameters are alaways assumed to be fixed
    x̄, s^2 === sample/random statistics
    random sample collected to reduce bias and increase generalizability

plots
  box-whisker/box-cox plot === based on min, max, median, Q1, and Q3
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    if value outside of (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR), then it's considered an outlier
      represeneted by * or circle
